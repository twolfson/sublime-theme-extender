# sublime-theme-extender

Extend and customize Sublime Text themes

**Abandoned for now:** Sublime Text 2 does not easily support reading/writing plists/XML with the Python built-ins. We could not find a non-compiled Python library that would work for XML so we have abandoned ship for now.

## Getting Started
### Installation
This package is available under `theme-extender` inside of [Package Control][], a [Sublime Text][] plugin that allows for easy management of other plugins.

[Sublime Text]: http://www.sublimetext.com/
[Package Control]: http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control

If you prefer the manual route, you can install the script via the following command in the Sublime Text terminal (``ctrl+` ``) which utilizes `git clone`.

```python
import os; path=sublime.packages_path(); (os.makedirs(path) if not os.path.exists(path) else None); window.run_command('exec', {'cmd': ['git', 'clone', 'https://github.com/twolfson/sublime-theme-extender', 'theme-extender'], 'working_dir': path})
```

Packages can be uninstalled via "Package Control: Remove Package" via the command pallete, `ctrl+shift+p` on Windows/Linux, `command+shift+p` on Mac.
